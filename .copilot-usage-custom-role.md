# Creating a Custom Role for GitHub Copilot Usage Access

This guide explains how to create a custom organization role that grants users access to view GitHub Copilot usage metrics without requiring full Organization Owner privileges.

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** subscription (custom organization roles are not available on Team plan)
- **Organization Owner** role or a user with "Manage custom organization roles" permission

## Permission Required

| Permission Name | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **View organization Copilot metrics** | View Copilot usage metrics for your organization |

## Step 1: Create the Custom Role

1. Navigate to your organization: `github.com/orgs/{your-org}/settings`
2. In the sidebar, go to **Access** → **Organization roles** → **Role management**
3. Click **"Create a role"**
4. Configure the role:
   - **Name:** `Copilot Usage Viewer`
   - **Description:** `Can view Copilot usage and code generation metrics`
5. Under **"Add permissions"**, click the **Organization** tab
6. Select: ✅ **View organization Copilot metrics**
7. Click **"Create role"**

## Step 2: Assign the Role to Users

1. Go to **Settings** → **Organization roles** → **Role assignments**
2. Click **"New role assignment"**
3. Search for and select the users or teams you want to grant access
4. Select the `Copilot Usage Viewer` role from the dropdown
5. Click **"Add new assignment"**

## Step 3: Verify Access

Have the assigned user navigate to:
- `github.com/orgs/{your-org}/settings/copilot/usage`

They should now be able to view the Copilot usage dashboard.

## Additional Permissions (Optional)

If users need additional capabilities, consider adding these permissions:

| Permission | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| View organization Copilot seat assignments | View who has Copilot seats assigned |
| Manage organization Copilot seat assignments | Assign/revoke Copilot seats |

## API Access

For programmatic access to Copilot metrics via the REST API, users will need a personal access token with the `manage_billing:copilot` scope.

## Notes

- Custom roles are additive - users can have multiple roles assigned
- The "View organization Copilot metrics" permission primarily grants API access to metrics
- Full dashboard access may still require Organization Owner or Billing Manager role for some views
- Test with a non-owner user after assignment to confirm expected access levels
